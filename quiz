Question 1
During cluster initialization, your kubeadm init command fails at the preflight phase. As a systems administrator, which component should you investigate first to resolve connectivity issues between cluster nodes?

Network Connectivity
The content emphasizes that network connectivity between nodes is a critical requirement for Kubernetes cluster initialization, and failure to establish proper network communication can prevent successful preflight checks.

Question 2
After running kubeadm init successfully, you notice that CoreDNS pods remain in a pending state. What critical cluster component must be configured next to resolve this issue?

Network Plugin
The content explicitly states that CoreDNS pods will remain in a pending state until a network plugin is deployed to configure the pod network, which is a critical step after cluster initialization.

Question 3
Your development team needs to understand the container architecture. Which component serves as the standardized interface that allows different container runtimes to work with Kubernetes?

Container Network Interface (CNI)
The Open Containers Initiative (OCI) ensures standardization through the Container Network Interface (CNI), which provides a generic interface enabling different container runtimes to work seamlessly with Kubernetes.

Question 4
You are tasked with setting up a production Kubernetes cluster for your organization. What is the minimum RAM requirement per node that you must provision to ensure kubeadm can successfully initialize the control plane?

According to the content, kubeadm requires at least 2GB of RAM on control plane nodes to successfully initialize and run Kubernetes cluster components effectively.

Question 5
When evaluating network plugins for your production environment, your security team requires support for Network Policy enforcement to implement microsegmentation. Based on the available options, which network plugin would you recommend that provides comprehensive feature support including Network Policy capabilities?

Calico
Calico is explicitly described in the content as 'probably the most common network plugin with support for all relevant features', which directly addresses the requirement for comprehensive Network Policy support for microsegmentation

Question 1
Your organization needs to perform scheduled maintenance on a worker node that currently hosts several production applications. Which approach would ensure minimal service disruption while preventing new workloads from being scheduled on the node?

Use kubectl cordon on the worker node
Kubectl cordon marks the node as unschedulable while allowing existing pods to continue running, ensuring minimal disruption during maintenance

Question 2
A system administrator notices that a Kubernetes worker node shows as 'NotReady' in the cluster status. After connecting to the node via SSH, what sequence of diagnostic steps would be most effective to identify the root cause of this issue?

Check kubelet service status and logs
Checking kubelet service status and logs provides direct insight into why the node is not reporting as ready, as kubelet is responsible for node communication and pod management

Question 3
A critical monitoring agent must remain operational even during API server outages or cluster control plane failures. What implementation strategy would guarantee the agent's availability under these conditions?

Deploy as a static pod
Static pods are managed directly by kubelet and can run independently of the API server, ensuring continuous operation during control plane failures

Question 4
When examining container activity on a Kubernetes node, which tool provides the most comprehensive view of running containers and their associated pods without relying on Docker or Podman?

crictl
CriCTL is a generic container runtime interface tool specifically designed for Kubernetes to manage and inspect containers across different runtime environments

Question 5
What mechanism does Kubernetes use to prevent pods from being scheduled on nodes that have been marked as unschedulable through the cordon command?

Taints
When a node is cordoned using kubectl cordon, Kubernetes automatically sets a taint on the node, which prevents new pods from being scheduled on that node. This ensures that the node is marked as unschedulable and no new workloads are placed on it during maintenance or other critical operations.
